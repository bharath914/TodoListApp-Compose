This is an Todo List application
This app is made using **Kotlin**, **Compose**


Complete Tech Stack
- **Compose** - For Building the UI
- **MVVM** - Main Architecture to build this application
- **Clean** - Principles used in this architecture.
- **Dagger Hilt** - Used for dependency Injection
- **Room** - Database for storing the data


I had used Clean architecture for building this app which is a great way to scale the applications. This architecture is being used in many major apps which helps them to scale the applications to their required extent.

We need to follow strict guide lines to build an application in Clean architecture. Irrespective of the tech stack clean architecture can be applied to any application.

**Database**

I had used the room database to store the persistent data
and it supports asynchronous data flows to efficiently update the UI.

**Jetpack Compose**

Jetpack Compose to build highly efficient UI and Material3 Design for stunning UI.

**Dagger Hilt**

This is popular tool released by Google for dependency injection.
we create a instance of classes at once and use them anywhere in the app.
